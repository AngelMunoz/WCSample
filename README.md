# Bolero WC Sample

Run with 
```
dotnet run -p WCSample.Server
```

when loading the page it should process any web component (since they work as any other html tag) but it doesn't show
![No Bolero](./no-hello-fsbolero.png) 

after saving the file the web component actually shows
![Yes Bolero](./yes-hello-fsbolero.png)
